					<h4>Persona Type Tested: <span>Primary/Secondary</span></h4>
					<h5>Context: <span>an environment (location) where the user is comfortable without
							distractions</span> </h5>
					<h5>Duration: <span>15 minutes</span></h5>

			<div class="usabilityTestObjectives">
				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Determine how intuitive the main flow of the application is. </li>
					<li>Identify possible bottle-necks in the 'search product' workflow</li>
					<li>Users shall be able to perform the task: 'search product'</li>
					<li>Determine how quickly users find the results</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
				<h5>Scenario</h5>
				<p>User is shopping online and finds a product that he might buy. He does not have too many insights
					about that vendor so he wants to verify the genuineness of the product. In addition he wants to find
					all
					the alternatives. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="usabilityTestDetails">
				<div class="detailsLeft">
					<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<p>Primary persona</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Open the app - 3 seconds</li>
						<li>Sign up - 10 - 30 seconds (depends on the method)</li>
						<li>Search a product - 15 seconds</li>
						<li>View & inspect results - 10 seconds </li>
						<li>Go to a product page from the results - 5 seconds</li>
						<li>Review the results - 3 seconds</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Secondary persona</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Open the app - 5 seconds</li>
						<li>Sign up - 20 - 40 seconds (depends on the method)</li>
						<li>Search a product - 20 seconds</li>
						<li>View & inspect results - 15 seconds </li>
						<li>Go to a product page from the results - 10 seconds</li>
						<li>Review the results - 5 seconds</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Is 'search product' action easy to perform?</li>
						<li>Would you prefer other methods for selecting the image (crop, copy-paste)? </li>
						<li>How often would you rate a result?</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="detailsRight">
					<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what
							they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
						<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
						<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
							sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
						<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
							Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
						<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
							"What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

				<p>A successful design has been achieved when:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>100% of users searched a product successfully</li>
					<li>66% of users reached a product page from the results</li>
					<li>33% of users reviewed a result</li>

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>3 users found quickly how to perform a 'search product' task </li>

				<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>.
					If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is an issue with
					the design. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would
					be <strong>0</strong>. </p>

				<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
				<p>Is 'search product' action easy to perform? - <b>Yes</b></p>

				<h5>Test Observations</h5>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>User 1</b>: he managed to accomplish all the tasks very fast; he understood the flow
							easily; he did not like that the results weren't very good (the product did not math); he
							would like to have a price convertor; he did not like the logo. </li>
						<li><b>User 2</b>: she understood the flow overall; she had some privacy concerns; results
							should auto-expand;
							she would like to mark results as favorite; she liked the review system; she liked the
							design and the colors;
						</li>
						<li><b>User 3</b>: she is not an expert in technology; it took some time to sign-up but she did
							it alone;
							she hasn't seen the info snackbar so she missed the first click; then she managed to search
							a product;
							she liked the design and found the results easily but it took some time to expand them; she
							opened very fast a product page and reviewed the result easily; the app is easy to use;
