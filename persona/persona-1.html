				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p></p>
                <p>Being a report developer, Andrei spends most of the time working on the computer. Because of this, he <strong>loves online shopping</strong> and does it frequently (<strong>2-3 times per week</strong>), buying all kind of stuffs.</p>
				<p>At the same time, he does not have too much time to do research when shopping online, but because he <strong>enjoys getting great deals</strong>, he usually <strong>uses price comparison tools.</strong></p>
				<p>Most of the time he encounters several problems with those comparison tools: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Because he has to search by keywords he does not find the product that he wants.</li>
					<li>He gets results only from affiliated stores.</li>
					<li>He does not know if the store/vendor is reliable.</li>
				</ul> 
				<p>Several times he <strong>has been ripped-off by different vendors</strong> due to the fact that he did not find alternatives to the product that he was looking for. Later on, he used to find that product much cheaper on other websites.</p>
				<p>Andrei is also a very sociable person and he usually <strong>shares his shopping experiences with his friends.</strong> He uses social media to find new stores/vendors (ads, friends).</p>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>When Andrei wants to do some online shopping, he opens the chrome extension in his browser and starts surfing on e-commerce websites. With only one click on the product image he can finds all the alternatives for the exact same item without leaving the current tab/product link. In addition, he can always check what other people/friends say about vendors and products.</p>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
					<p></p>

					<p>She <strong>buys mostly electronics</strong> from the internet because she <strong>finds cheaper alternatives.</strong> However, she <strong>has never user a price comparison tool</strong> before because she does not trust them (they are practicing affiliate commissions).</p>
					<p>She also buys original brands even if she pays more because she feels a lot safer</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Did not use chrome extensions before.</li>
						<li>Did not have bad online shopping experience because she is trying to avoid scams (buying only original brands)</li>
						<li>She usually uses romanian online stores because she does not like to do currency conversion (time wasting) </li>
					</ul>
