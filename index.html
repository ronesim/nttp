      <p>
        A browser extension that compares products (price, shipping rates and times, specs, rating) via reverse image
        search.
        You can go on any website (e-commerce, social media) and with 1 click on any product image, we show you where
        you can
        find better deals for the exact same item. We also crowdsource information from users who have purchased items
        on the
        website you're browsing and warn you if the site is fake, made to steal credit card information, didn't respect
        return
        policies or has huge mark-ups.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Nowadays, everyone is betting on dropshipping and getting in on it (50% of e-commerce in 2018). Shopify's stock
        is skyrocketing. But we think the way to make a serious impact and earn high returns is to bet against
        conventional wisdom.
        Many people have told us that dropshipping is legit because they create brands and people understand that they
        pay a bit more because the products find them through ads that the dropshipper buys on social media.
        But when you show someone that the exact same watch or dress they bought for 70$ is actually 5.95$(including
        shipping) if you buy directly from the supplier, the answer I always get is "This is not branding, this is
        bullshit!".
        Put it another way high margins can only exist in situations of high informational asymmetry. Transparency is
        the ultimate nightmare for unethical vendors. And that's our mantra "Let's keep e-commerce honest!".

        In the first section we briefly described the main goals of the application and now we are going to focus

        Design patterns used:
        <ul>
          <li>Extras on demand - used for displaying results</li>
          <li>Hub and spoke - used for spliting home actions, profile and store</li>
          <li>Modal panel - used for different types of actions like delete and review result</li>
        </ul>
        Visual design patterns:
        <ul>
          <li>Inline forms and validation</li>
          <li>Notifications</li>

        <h3>First idea</h3>
        <p>
          The first idea is to implement a chrome extension that is going to work on every website. It is very useful to
          have this because
          users do not want to leave the active tab while they are shopping, in order to check for a product.
          There are 2 main actions: search a product and report a product.</p>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

          <figcaption>
            Sketche 1: While user is shopping, he can use NTTP chrome extension in order to search or report a product.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        In order to verify a product the user should follow these steps:
        <ul>
          <li>Install and open the extension</li>
          <li>Sign-up/sign-in using Google or email</li>
          <li>Activate tool from the main action tab</li>
          <li>Click on a product image and wait a few seconds</li>
          <li>Inspect the results</li>
        </ul>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

        </figure>
      </section>
      <section id="second-idea">
        <h3>Second idea</h3>
        <p>
          The second idea is to implement a widget, which is included in the chrome extension, in order to display the
          reports/reviews for a vendor/product.
          Users can view an overall score for each vendor and all the reviews for a specific product so they can take
          decisions based on this feedback. In addition,
          they can report products in order to help other users to avoid scams and fraud. </p>

            Storyboard 2: Users can avoid scams and fraud using crowdsourcing.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        In order to avoid a scam/fraud the user should follow these steps:
        <ul>
          <li>Install and open the extension</li>
          <li>Sign-up/sign-in using Google or email</li>
          <li>Go to an e-commerce website</li>
          <li>Report products in order to help others</li>

      <section id="third-idea">
        <h3>Third idea</h3>
        <p>
          The last idea is to build a mobile app that allows people to search for products and find better alternatives.
          This idea might be a bit tricky
          because mobile browsers does not support extensions. The only alternative is to allow user to upload a
          screenshot of the product image in our app.

      <p>We have chosen to implement the chrome extension because it is very easy to use (users do not have to leave
        their current page) and it is very fast (has access to the DOM).
        Regarding implementation, all the methods needs a web server but web apps are much easier to implement because
        there are a lots of frameworks and tutorials.

      <p>We have chosen to implement the selection mode firstly because it is much intuitive and convenient for users.
        Having the chrome extension is very easy to get
        the image from the DOM and to process it in the server.

        going to add the input fields for more complex reviews.
